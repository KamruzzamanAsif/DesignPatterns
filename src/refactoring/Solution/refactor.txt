>>>>>> FizzBuzz.java <<<<<<<<
1. Inappropriate naming smell:
    Method name "say" doesn't make any sense about its functionality
    So, I changed the name to "getStringOnBasisOfNumber"
2. Long method smell:
    The method "say" is hard to quickly comprehend
    So, I extract method isFactorOfThree() and isFactorOfFive()
3. Data redundancy:
    The variable "strReturn" is redundant here
    We can simply return our desired string directly
4. Comment smell:
    The class has some comments to understand its responsibility
    I increased the understanding of its responsibility through
    the above described actions in point 1, 2, and 3.


>>>>>> PlaintextToHtmlConverter <<<<<<<
1. Black Sheep smell:
    The method "read" is noticeably different from other methods in
    the class. So, I made a new class named "FileReader" and added
    a "readFile" method for reading files which is being called from
    our main class.
