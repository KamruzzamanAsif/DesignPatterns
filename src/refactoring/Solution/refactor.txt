>>>>>> FizzBuzz.java <<<<<<<<
1. Inappropriate naming smell:
    Method name "say" doesn't make any sense about its functionality
    So, I changed the name to "getStringOnBasisOfNumber"
2. Long method smell:
    The method "say" is hard to quickly comprehend
    So, I extract method isFactorOfThree() and isFactorOfFive()
3. Data redundancy:
    The variable "strReturn" is redundant here
    We can simply return our desired string directly
4. Comment smell:
    The class has some comments to understand its responsibility
    I increased the understanding of its responsibility through
    the above described actions in point 1, 2, and 3.


>>>>>> PlaintextToHtmlConverter <<<<<<<
1. Black Sheep smell:
    i. The method "read" is noticeably different from other methods in
        the class. So, I made a new class named "FileReader" and added
        a "readFile" method for reading files which is being called from
        our main class.
    ii. Resetting the list "convertedLine" in method "addNewLine()" is not
        appropriate. So I made a new method named "resetConvertedLine" for
        this task.
2. Redundant method:
    The method "toHtml()" is redundant I think as I added a Main class
    and FileReader class. Now toHtml() method just returns the encoded
    html but that can be achieved directly from "basicHtmlEncode()" method.
3. Inappropriate naming smell:
    i.  The variable "source" inappropriate to refer plain text. I rename this
        as "plainText"
    ii. The variable "result" is renamed to "htmlText" for better understanding
4. Comment smell:
    Both stashNextCharacterAndAdvanceThePointer() and addNewLine() method has
    comments to understand their functionality. The former is solved in point 5(i)
    and later is solved in point 1(ii)
5. Long method smell:
    i. The "basicHtmlEncode()" method is hard to quickly comprehend and
        the lines of code is large. Here, if we add a for each loop to
        read characters form out plainText then it reduces the problem.
        As for this:
            * There is no need of the method "stashNextCharacterAndAdvanceThePointer()"
               we can safely remove it.
            * There is no need of the variable "characterToConvert", "character", and "i" anymore
            * And no need to check the break condition every time we iterate the loop
    ii. The variable "finalResult" is unnecessary here. We can use inline variable
        instead of this.
